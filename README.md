# Vehicle-Detection-Speed-Detection

🚗 Vehicle Detection & Speed Monitoring System 🚨

📋 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Vehicle Detection and Speed Monitoring System using advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. The system processes 

real-time video feeds to detect vehicles, classify them, and accurately calculate their speeds. It is a practical solution for traffic management and safety enforcement.

The system leverages tools like OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow for model training, making it capable of detecting and monitoring vehicles effectively, even in 

dynamic traffic scenarios.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

OpenCV 📷 (Image Processing)

TensorFlow 🤖 (Machine Learning)

NumPy 🔢 (Numerical Operations)

Matplotlib 📊 (Visualization)

Pandas 📊 (Data Handling)

🔍 Features

Vehicle Detection: Identifies and classifies vehicles (cars, trucks, motorcycles, etc.) in real-time using object detection models. 🚙🚛🏍️

Speed Calculation: Calculates vehicle speeds based on frame analysis and distance measurements. ⚡

Real-time Monitoring: Processes live video feeds from cameras for continuous traffic monitoring. 📹

Scalable Solution: Can be deployed in various environments, such as highways, urban areas, and parking lots. 🌍

🏁 How It Works

Capture Video Feed 🎥

Real-time footage is captured using a camera and fed into the system for processing.

Vehicle Detection 👀

Using OpenCV and deep learning models, the system detects vehicles in each frame. The detection model is trained with TensorFlow to classify different types of vehicles.

Speed Estimation 🚗💨

By analyzing the vehicle’s movement between frames, the system calculates its speed based on a reference distance.

Output 📊

The system outputs the detected vehicles along with their speed, which can be displayed on a user interface or logged for analysis.

🚀 Installation

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x

Pip (Python Package Installer)

Steps:
Clone the repository:

bash
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the system:

bash
Copy code
python vehicle_speed_monitor.py

📊 Example Output
The system will display live video with bounding boxes around detected vehicles and their calculated speed. For example:

Car: Speed = 65 km/h
Truck: Speed = 50 km/h
🔧 Customization
Vehicle Detection Model: You can replace the current vehicle detection model with your own trained model if needed.
Distance Reference: Adjust the reference distance based on the camera setup to ensure accurate speed calculations.
Video Source: Change the input video feed to use either a webcam or an existing video file.
🚨 Potential Applications
Traffic Surveillance: Monitor real-time traffic conditions and enforce speed limits. 🛣️
Smart Cities: Integrate with urban management systems for automated traffic control. 🌆
Law Enforcement: Provide automated evidence for speeding violations. 👮‍♂️
💡 Future Improvements
Multi-lane Support: Enhance the system to handle multiple lanes of traffic simultaneously. 🚘🚗
Integration with IoT: Integrate with smart traffic lights or automated ticketing systems. 🌐
Cloud-Based Monitoring: Use cloud infrastructure for large-scale deployment and remote monitoring. ☁️
